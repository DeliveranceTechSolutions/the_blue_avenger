Change .sampleEnv to .env

#### DO NOT make 2 accounts

The current chrome version is 93+, if this project does not work then there are two possible reasons:
    - Linkedin has updated their frontend api and there are some busted lxml references.
    - If you have a chromedriver issue, then find out the version of your browser and replace the driver in assets.

#### Your browser must match the version of the driver or selenium will not run.
#### Find Chrome Version -> (3 dots to the right, settings, About Chrome on the left menu all the way to the bottom) Aug 2021

Linkedin amended their policy implementing new verification methods, so leaving the bot running is much more reliable than last year once you verify or log in.

It is hard to say whether you can scrape the site since tech companies create highly ambigious agreements with users, but Linkedin says it's cool now so.

The reason why I put thos bot together is because I do NOT like LinkedIn whatsoever.  Getting a job today is more about looking the part than having the actual skills.

On top of that, Linkedin FORCES YOU TO APPLY TO THIS STUFF YOURSELF!!!

You already gave them your (or some) personal data, which is extremely valuable human input.  It support a culture of do-nothing-until-you-are-doing-something.

Coding interviews are not bad but it is so time consuming to keep that skill in check.  Experience can help but at the end of the day, large companies make the application process extremely painful so when you think about leaving....you don't ðŸ˜­
