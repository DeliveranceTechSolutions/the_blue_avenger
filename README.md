#### DO NOT make 2 accounts

The current chrome version is 93+, if this project does not work then there are two possible reasons:
    - Linkedin has updated their frontend api and there are some busted lxml references.
    - If you have a chromedriver issue, then find out the version of your browser and replace the driver in assets.

#### Your browser must match the version of the driver or selenium will not run.
#### Find Chrome Version -> (3 dots to the right, settings, About Chrome on the right menu all the way to the bottom) Aug 2021


# WARNING :warning:

#### If you use this script on https://Linkedin.com/in/ you are at risk of violating the Linkedin's TOS agreement. 

Linkedin amended their policy implementing new verification methods, so leaving the bot running is much more reliable than last year once you verify or log in.

# Leave the window maximized

#### You are not allowed to access the Linkedin services using automation, anything done with this script 

#### will be your responsibility.
